## Notes & Decisions

### SendGrid vs Resend
- Resend package is installed but we're using SendGrid per user preference
- User has SendGrid API key ready to use

### Analytics Approach
- Using activity logging table for detailed tracking
- Recharts already installed for visualizations
- Keeping initial metrics focused but comprehensive

### Billing Approach
- Using Stripe Checkout (not full Elements) for faster implementation
- Three-tier model: Starter, Professional, Enterprise
- Webhook handling for subscription status updates

### Scope Management
- Building MVP versions of each feature
- Focus on working end-to-end flows
- Polish can come in future iterations
- All features should be production-ready but simple

---

## Risk Mitigation

**Stripe Webhook Testing:**
- Use Stripe CLI for local webhook testing
- `stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3001/api/stripe/webhook`

**Email Deliverability:**
- Ensure SendGrid domain verification done
- Test with multiple email providers
- Add proper SPF/DKIM records

**Database Migrations:**
- Test migrations on local Supabase first
- Backup data before applying
- Verify RLS policies after migration

---

## Post-Session Tasks

After completing all features:
- [ ] Update ROADMAP.md to mark Phase 1 as 100% complete
- [ ] Git commit with message: "Complete Phase 1: Admin features, analytics, settings, and billing"
- [ ] Test all features one more time end-to-end
- [ ] Document any known issues or future enhancements
