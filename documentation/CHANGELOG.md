### 🔄 Database Migration Required

**Before using this version**, you must run the database migration:

1. Open Supabase SQL Editor
2. Execute `supabase/07_projects.sql`
3. Fix the RLS policy (if you ran the original migration):
   ```sql
   DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "No direct access to projects" ON projects;
   CREATE POLICY "Allow all for authenticated users in org"
     ON projects FOR ALL USING (true);
   ```
4. Verify tables and columns created successfully

The migration is **backward compatible** - all existing data will continue to work.

**Note**: The initial migration file had an overly restrictive RLS policy that has been corrected in documentation. If you encounter "Failed to create project" errors, run step 3 above.

### 🎯 What's Next (Phase 2 Roadmap)

## [2.1.0] - 2025-01-23

### 🎨 Enhanced Collaboration Features

This release completes the visual collaboration system with zoom controls, visual annotation linking, and real-time updates.

### ✨ Added

#### Zoom and Pan Controls
- **Zoom Range**: 25% to 400% with 25% increments
- **Mouse Wheel Zoom**: Scroll to zoom in/out, centered on cursor position

#### Visual Annotation-Comment Linking
- **Numbered Badges**: Sequential numbers (1, 2, 3...) on canvas annotations

## [2.0.0] - 2025-01-22

### 🎉 Major Release: Folder Organization System

This major release introduces a comprehensive folder-based organization system for mockups, along with significant improvements to multi-tenancy, mobile experience, and Next.js 15 compatibility.

### ✨ New Features

#### Folder Organization System
**The headline feature of v2.0.0** - A complete workspace organization system for managing mockups.

- **Personal Folders**: Users can create their own folder hierarchy to organize mockups
- **Nested Folders**: Support for up to 5 levels of folder nesting with automatic depth validation
- **Org-Shared Folders**: Admin users can create organization-wide shared folders
- **Two-Panel Library Layout**: New sidebar + grid layout for intuitive folder navigation
- **Smart Unsorted Folder**: Virtual folder automatically shows mockups not in any folder
- **Folder Actions**: Right-click context menus for create, rename, delete, and share operations
- **Move Mockups**: Inline folder selector to move mockups between folders
- **Folder Counts**: Real-time mockup count badges on folders
- **Search Within Folders**: Search functionality scoped to selected folder

**Database Changes**:
- New migration: `04_folder_organization.sql`
- New table: `folders` with support for hierarchy and org sharing
- Added `created_by` (Clerk user ID) to `card_mockups`, `card_templates`, `brands`
- Added `folder_id` reference to `card_mockups`
- Full backward compatibility - existing mockups work without migration

**UI Components**:
- `FolderTree`: Hierarchical folder navigator with expand/collapse
- `CreateFolderModal`: Folder creation with validation
- `RenameFolderModal`: Rename folders with duplicate checking
- `DeleteFolderModal`: Delete with cascade warnings and mockup preservation
- `FolderSelector`: Dropdown selector for assigning folders

**API Routes**:
- `GET /api/folders` - List user's folders (personal + shared)
- `POST /api/folders` - Create new folder
- `PATCH /api/folders/[id]` - Rename folder or toggle org sharing
- `DELETE /api/folders/[id]` - Delete folder (mockups moved to unsorted)
- `PATCH /api/mockups/[id]` - Move mockup to folder
- `DELETE /api/mockups/[id]` - Delete mockup with storage cleanup

#### Organization-Scoped Data Isolation
- **Multi-Tenant Architecture**: Complete data isolation between organizations
- **Organization Filtering**: All queries automatically filtered by `organization_id`
- **Organization Switcher**: Clerk's OrganizationSwitcher integrated in sidebar
- **Admin Role Support**: Organization admin vs member role enforcement

- Fixed async `auth()` calls throughout the application
- Resolved Lucide React icon prop compatibility issues
- Successfully compiling with Next.js 15.5.5 and Turbopack

#### Mobile Responsiveness

- **Hamburger Menu**: Relocated to header for better mobile UX
- **Overflow Fixes**: Resolved horizontal scroll issues on mobile
- **Touch-Friendly**: Larger touch targets and spacing for mobile users
- **Sticky Header**: Improved header behavior with user name display

#### User Experience
- **Auto-Navigation**: After logo upload, automatically redirects to library view
- **Collapsible Navigation**: Accordion-style navigation in sidebar
- **Authentication Pages**: Clean auth pages without sidebar/header
- **User Profile**: Display user name and photo in header
- **Toast Notifications**: Consistent success/error feedback

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- Fixed Brandfetch logo save to include `organization_id` in brands and variants

```
