## [2.3.0] - 2025-01-24

### üìÅ Projects Feature (Phase 1)

This release introduces **Projects** - a new organizational layer for managing mockups by client engagement. Projects act as containers to group related mockups together, making it easier to organize work by client, campaign, or initiative.

### ‚ú® Added

#### Project Management System
- **Create Projects**: New project creation with name, client name, description, status, and custom color
- **Project Status Types**: Three status options for workflow management
  - **Active**: Currently in progress projects
  - **Completed**: Finished projects
  - **Archived**: Historical projects for reference

  - Orange (#F59E0B), Red (#EF4444), Indigo (#6366F1), Teal (#14B8A6)
- **Visual Mockup Previews**: Project cards display up to 4 thumbnail previews
- **Mockup Count Badges**: Real-time count of mockups per project

#### Projects List Page (`/projects`)
- **Grid Layout**: Clean card-based layout showing all projects
- **Search Functionality**: Search projects by name, client name, or description
- **Status Filtering**: Filter projects by Active, Completed, or Archived status
- **Quick Actions**: Edit and delete projects from card menu
- **Empty States**: Helpful guidance when no projects exist or no results found

#### Project Detail Page (`/projects/[id]`)
- **Project Overview**: Header with name, client, description, status, and color indicator
- **Mockup Gallery**: Grid view of all mockups assigned to the project
- **Mockup Search**: Search within project mockups
- **Mockup Actions**: View, download, and delete mockups directly from project view
- **Back Navigation**: Easy return to projects list

#### Database Schema
- **New Table**: `projects` with full metadata support
- **Status Enum**: `project_status` type ('active', 'completed', 'archived')
- **Mockup Association**: `project_id` column added to `card_mockups` table
- **Cascade Handling**: ON DELETE SET NULL ensures mockups preserved when project deleted
- **Performance Indexes**: Optimized queries for organization_id, status, and project_id
- **RLS Policies**: Secure access through API routes only

#### API Routes
- `GET /api/projects` - List all projects with mockup counts and previews
- `POST /api/projects` - Create new project with validation
- `GET /api/projects/[id]` - Get single project with full details
- `PATCH /api/projects/[id]` - Update project (name, client, description, status, color)
- `DELETE /api/projects/[id]` - Delete project (mockups preserved, unassigned)
- `GET /api/projects/[id]/mockups` - List all mockups for a project
- `PATCH /api/mockups/[id]` - Updated to support project_id assignment

#### UI Components
- **NewProjectModal**: Full-featured modal for creating projects
  - Required project name field (max 100 characters)
  - Optional client name and description
  - Status dropdown (defaults to 'active')
  - Color picker with 8 preset colors
  - Form validation and error handling

- **TypeScript Types**: Added `Project`, `ProjectStatus` interfaces to `lib/supabase.ts`

### üìù Technical Details

**New Files**:
- `supabase/07_projects.sql` - Database migration for projects feature
- `lib/supabase.ts` - Added Project and ProjectStatus TypeScript types
- `app/api/projects/route.ts` - Projects list and create API
- `app/api/projects/[id]/route.ts` - Individual project CRUD API
- `app/api/projects/[id]/mockups/route.ts` - Project mockups listing API
- `components/projects/NewProjectModal.tsx` - Project creation modal
- `components/projects/ProjectCard.tsx` - Project card component
- `app/(dashboard)/projects/page.tsx` - Projects list page

- `components/SidebarSimple.tsx` - Added Projects navigation link

**Database Changes**:
- New enum type: `project_status`
- New table: `projects` with 10 fields
- New column: `card_mockups.project_id` (nullable UUID)

- New trigger: `update_projects_updated_at` for timestamp management

**Key Features**:
- Organization-scoped: All projects isolated by `organization_id`
- Permission-based: Only project creator or org admin can edit/delete
- Backward compatible: Existing mockups work without projects
- Nullable association: Mockups can exist without project assignment
- Soft delete: Deleting project unassigns mockups (doesn't delete them)

### üîÑ Database Migration Required

**Before using this version**, you must run the database migration:

1. Open Supabase SQL Editor
2. Execute `supabase/07_projects.sql`
3. Verify tables and columns created successfully

The migration is **backward compatible** - all existing data will continue to work.

### üéØ What's Next (Phase 2 Roadmap)

Future enhancements planned for Projects:
- **Multi-column Kanban Layout**: Drag-and-drop between project status columns
- **Bulk Operations**: Assign multiple mockups to a project at once
- **Project Selector in Mockup Library**: Quick-assign dropdown in mockup cards
- **Project Editing Modal**: In-place editing without navigation
- **Advanced Filtering**: Filter by date range, creator, mockup count
- **Project Templates**: Save project configurations as templates
- **Project Analytics**: Time tracking, completion rates, mockup velocity
- **Project Sharing**: Share project URLs with clients for review
- **Export Project**: Download all mockups as ZIP archive
