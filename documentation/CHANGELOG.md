### üîÑ Database Migration Required

**Before using this version**, you must run the database migration:

1. Open Supabase SQL Editor
2. Execute `supabase/07_projects.sql`

   ```sql
   DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "No direct access to projects" ON projects;
   CREATE POLICY "Allow all for authenticated users in org"
     ON projects FOR ALL USING (true);
   ```
4. Verify tables and columns created successfully

The migration is **backward compatible** - all existing data will continue to work.

**Note**: The initial migration file had an overly restrictive RLS policy that has been corrected in documentation. If you encounter "Failed to create project" errors, run step 3 above.
