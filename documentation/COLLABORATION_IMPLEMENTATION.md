## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

This will install the newly added `@sendgrid/mail` package.

### Step 2: Run Database Migration

1. Open your Supabase dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Copy and execute the contents of `supabase/05_collaboration.sql`
4. Verify tables were created:
   - `mockup_comments`
   - `mockup_reviewers`

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

Add these to your `.env.local` file:

```env
# SendGrid Email (optional but recommended)
SENDGRID_API_KEY=SG.your_key_here
SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL=noreply@yourdomain.com
SENDGRID_FROM_NAME=Asset Studio

# App URL (for email links)
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000  # Or your production URL
```

**SendGrid Setup** (optional for Day 1 testing):
1. Go to https://sendgrid.com and create an account (free tier available)
2. Create an API key with "Mail Send" permission
3. Verify a sender email address in SendGrid settings
4. Add credentials to `.env.local`

**Note**: If SendGrid is not configured, the app will still work but email notifications will be skipped with a console warning.

### Step 4: Start Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Real-Time Stack
- **Supabase Realtime**: WebSocket subscriptions for live updates
- **Postgres Changes**: Listen to INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE on comments and reviewers tables
- **Auto-sync**: UI updates immediately when database changes

### Annotation Storage
- **Format**: Konva shape objects stored as JSONB in `annotation_data` field
- **Example Arrow**:
  ```json
  {
    "type": "arrow",
    "points": [100, 150, 300, 200],
    "stroke": "#FF6B6B",
    "strokeWidth": 3,
    "pointerLength": 10,
    "pointerWidth": 10
  }
  ```
- **Example Pin**:
  ```json
  {
    "type": "pin",
    "position_x": 45.5,
    "position_y": 62.3,
    "annotation_color": "#4ECDC4"
  }
  ```

### Export Implementation
- **Clean Export**: Hides annotation layer, exports background only
- **Annotated Export**: Shows all annotations, exports composite
- **Format**: PNG at 2x pixel ratio for high resolution
- **Trigger**: Custom event `export-mockup` dispatched from page, handled by canvas

## 🎯 What's Next (Future Enhancements)

### Day 2: Planned Features
1. **My Reviews Page** (`/reviews`)
   - Centralized inbox for pending review requests
   - Badge count in header navigation
   - Filter by pending/completed

2. **Threaded Comment Replies**
   - Use `parent_comment_id` field for nested conversations
   - Indented reply UI

3. **Comment Notifications**
   - Email when someone comments on your mockup
   - Email when someone replies to your comment

4. **Annotation Highlighting**
   - Hover comment in sidebar → highlight annotation on canvas
   - Click annotation on canvas → scroll to comment in sidebar

### Day 3: Advanced Features
1. **Resolved Comments**
   - Mark comments as resolved (uses `is_resolved` field)
   - Filter view to show/hide resolved

2. **@Mentions**
   - Tag team members in comments
   - Send targeted notifications

3. **Version History**
   - Track mockup changes
   - Compare before/after versions

4. **Approval Workflow**
   - Require X approvals before mockup is "approved"
   - Status badges on library cards

## 📊 Performance Considerations

### Implemented Optimizations
- **Annotation Limit**: No hard limit yet, but recommend max 100 annotations per mockup
- **Real-Time Subscriptions**: Only active while mockup detail page is open
- **Lazy Loading**: Comments fetched on page load, not in library view
- **Image Optimization**: Mockup images rendered at appropriate canvas dimensions

### Future Optimizations
- Paginate comments if > 100
- Compress annotation_data JSON before storage
- Add database indexes on frequently queried fields (already done for mockup_id, user_id)

---

## 🔒 Security & Permissions

### Implemented Security
- **RLS Policies**: Database-level access control
- **Org Isolation**: All queries filtered by organization_id
- **Creator Permissions**: Only creators can invite reviewers
- **Reviewer Permissions**: Only invited reviewers can comment
- **Self-Ownership**: Users can only edit/delete their own comments
- **Clerk Integration**: All user IDs validated through Clerk auth

### Access Matrix

| Action | Creator | Reviewer | Other Org Members |
|--------|---------|----------|-------------------|
| View mockup | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Add annotation | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Edit own comment | ✅ | ✅ | N/A |
| Delete own comment | ✅ | ✅ | N/A |
| Invite reviewers | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Approve mockup | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Delete mockup | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Mockup not found" error when opening detail page
**Solution**: Ensure user is either the creator or an invited reviewer. Check `card_mockups.created_by` and `mockup_reviewers.reviewer_id`.

### Issue: Annotations not appearing on canvas
**Solution**: Check browser console for errors. Verify `annotation_data` is valid JSON in database.

### Issue: Real-time updates not working
**Solution**: Ensure Supabase Realtime is enabled. Check browser console for WebSocket connection errors.

### Issue: "Failed to fetch org members" when requesting feedback
**Solution**: Verify Clerk organization is properly configured. Check that `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` is set in environment variables.

### Issue: Email notifications not sending
**Solution**:
1. Check `SENDGRID_API_KEY` is set in `.env.local`
2. Verify SendGrid sender email is verified
3. Check server logs for SendGrid errors
4. Emails will skip silently if SendGrid is not configured (intentional)

### Issue: Canvas not rendering at correct size
**Solution**: Clear browser cache. Ensure container element has proper dimensions. Check `canvasDimensions` state in MockupCanvas component.

## 📝 Notes

- **Backward Compatible**: All existing mockups work without migration. Comments and reviewers are optional features.
- **Clerk Integration**: Uses existing Clerk auth and organization structure. No changes to auth flow.
- **SendGrid Optional**: App works without SendGrid, but emails won't be sent.
- **Next.js 15 Compatible**: All async params patterns implemented correctly.
- **Real-Time Optional**: If Supabase Realtime is unavailable, manual refresh still works.

## 🎓 Code Highlights

### Key Innovation: Annotation Storage
Instead of separate tables for each annotation type, we store all annotations as JSONB, making the system flexible for future annotation types without schema changes.

### Real-Time Pattern
```typescript
// Subscribe to changes
const subscription = supabase
  .channel(`mockup-${mockupId}-comments`)
  .on('postgres_changes',
    { event: 'INSERT', schema: 'public', table: 'mockup_comments' },
    (payload) => setComments(prev => [...prev, payload.new])
  )
  .subscribe();
```

### Export Pattern
```typescript
// Export with/without annotations
const handleExport = (includeAnnotations: boolean) => {
  if (!includeAnnotations) {
    annotationLayer.hide();
  }
  const dataURL = stage.toDataURL({ pixelRatio: 2 });
  // Download logic...
};
```
