---

## [3.1.6] - 2025-01-25

### üé® **Compact UI Redesign - Project Detail Page**

## [3.1.5] - 2025-01-25

### üêõ **Bugfix - Reviewer Display After Assignment**

Critical bugfix that fixes assigned reviewers not appearing in the UI due to API response property name mismatch.

### Fixed

#### Reviewer Data Fetching
- **ProjectStageReviewers Component** - Fixed property name mismatch in reviewer fetch
  - API returns: `{reviewers: [...]}`
  - Component was looking for: `{stage_reviewers: [...]}`
  - Changed component to use correct property name
  - Assigned reviewers now display immediately after assignment

#### Workflow Array Handling in POST
- **Add Reviewer Validation** - Fixed workflow data handling in POST endpoint
  - Added same array/object detection logic for workflows in POST endpoint
  - Prevents validation errors when adding reviewers
  - Ensures stage validation works correctly

### Technical

#### Root Cause
- GET `/api/projects/[id]/reviewers` returns `{reviewers: groupedReviewers}`
- Component `fetchStageReviewers()` was accessing `data.stage_reviewers`
- Property mismatch caused reviewers to never populate after fetch
- Reviewers were being saved to database but not displayed in UI

#### Solution
- Changed line 54 in ProjectStageReviewers.tsx: `data.stage_reviewers` ‚Üí `data.reviewers`
- Added workflow array handling in POST endpoint (lines 146-147)

### Impact
- ‚úÖ **Reviewers Display Correctly** - Assigned reviewers now show up in stage cards
- ‚úÖ **Real-time Updates** - Reviewers appear immediately after assignment
- ‚úÖ **Proper Validation** - Stage validation works when adding reviewers
- ‚úÖ **Complete Feature** - Reviewer assignment now fully functional end-to-end

---

## [3.1.4] - 2025-01-25

### üêõ **Bugfix - Organization Member Display**

Critical bugfix that fixes "undefined undefined" appearing in the reviewer selection dropdown by correcting the data structure mismatch between the API and UI component.

### Fixed

#### Member Data Structure
- **AddStageReviewerModal Interface** - Fixed mismatch between API response and component expectations
  - API returns: `{name, email, avatar, role}`
  - Component was expecting: `{firstName, lastName, emailAddresses[], imageUrl}`
  - Updated component to use correct property names from API
  - Reviewer names now display correctly in dropdown

### Technical

#### Root Cause
- The `/api/org/members` endpoint returns transformed member data
- The `AddStageReviewerModal` component was using Clerk's raw data structure
- Property name mismatches caused undefined values:
  - `firstName`/`lastName` ‚Üí should be `name`
  - `emailAddresses[0].emailAddress` ‚Üí should be `email`
  - `imageUrl` ‚Üí should be `avatar`

#### Solution
- Updated `OrganizationMember` interface to match API response
- Updated all property references throughout the modal component
- Member dropdown now shows actual names instead of "undefined undefined"

### Impact
- ‚úÖ **Reviewer Names Display** - Dropdown shows correct member names
- ‚úÖ **Avatar Display** - Member avatars render properly in preview
- ‚úÖ **Email Display** - Member emails show correctly in preview
- ‚úÖ **Functional Reviewer Assignment** - Can now successfully assign reviewers to stages

---

## [3.1.3] - 2025-01-25

### üêõ **Bugfix - Workflow Array Handling**

Critical bugfix that resolves `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '0')` when loading projects with workflows.

### Fixed

#### Workflow Data Type Handling
- **Array vs Object Handling** - Fixed Supabase JOIN returning workflow as array
  - Supabase `.select('*, workflows(*)')` can return data as array `[{...}]` or object `{...}`
  - Added logic to detect array and extract first element
  - Prevents undefined property access errors in UI
  - Now handles both array and object responses correctly

### Technical

#### Root Cause
- Supabase foreign key JOINs may return data as single-element array
- Previous fix assumed `workflows` would be an object
- UI tried to access `workflow.stages[0]` but workflow was actually `[{stages: [...]}]`
- This caused "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '0')" errors

#### Solution
```typescript
const workflowData = Array.isArray(workflows) ? workflows[0] : workflows;
```

### Impact
- ‚úÖ **Eliminates Console Errors** - No more TypeError when viewing projects
- ‚úÖ **Workflow UI Renders** - ProjectStageReviewers and WorkflowBoard display correctly
- ‚úÖ **Robust Data Handling** - Works regardless of Supabase response format

---

## [3.1.2] - 2025-01-25

### üêõ **Bugfix - Workflow Data Display**

Critical bugfix that resolves workflow data not being visible in the UI due to a property naming mismatch between the API and frontend.

### Fixed

#### Workflow Data Loading
- **API Property Naming** - Fixed mismatch between API response and UI expectations
  - Supabase JOIN returned workflow data as `workflows` (table name)
  - TypeScript interface and UI expected `workflow` (singular)
  - API now properly renames `workflows` ‚Üí `workflow` in response
  - This fix enables ProjectStageReviewers and WorkflowBoard to render correctly

### Technical

#### Root Cause
- Supabase query `.select('*, workflows(*)')` returns JOIN data using table name
- TypeScript `Project` interface defined property as `workflow?: Workflow`
- UI conditional checks like `{project?.workflow && ...}` evaluated to undefined
- Components (ProjectStageReviewers, WorkflowBoard) failed to render

#### Solution
- Added property renaming in `/api/projects/[id]/route.ts` GET handler
- Destructure `workflows` from response and rename to `workflow`
- Ensures API response matches TypeScript interface expectations

### Impact
- ‚úÖ **Workflow Board Now Visible** - Kanban board displays for projects with workflows
- ‚úÖ **Stage Reviewers Now Accessible** - UI for assigning reviewers now renders
- ‚úÖ **Complete v3.1.1 Feature** - Reviewer assignment functionality now fully functional

---
