## [2.0.0] - 2025-01-22

### üéâ Major Release: Folder Organization System

This major release introduces a comprehensive folder-based organization system for mockups, along with significant improvements to multi-tenancy, mobile experience, and Next.js 15 compatibility.

### ‚ú® New Features

#### Folder Organization System
**The headline feature of v2.0.0** - A complete workspace organization system for managing mockups.

- **Personal Folders**: Users can create their own folder hierarchy to organize mockups
- **Nested Folders**: Support for up to 5 levels of folder nesting with automatic depth validation
- **Org-Shared Folders**: Admin users can create organization-wide shared folders
- **Two-Panel Library Layout**: New sidebar + grid layout for intuitive folder navigation
- **Smart Unsorted Folder**: Virtual folder automatically shows mockups not in any folder
- **Folder Actions**: Right-click context menus for create, rename, delete, and share operations
- **Move Mockups**: Inline folder selector to move mockups between folders
- **Folder Counts**: Real-time mockup count badges on folders
- **Search Within Folders**: Search functionality scoped to selected folder

**Database Changes**:
- New migration: `04_folder_organization.sql`
- New table: `folders` with support for hierarchy and org sharing
- Added `created_by` (Clerk user ID) to `card_mockups`, `card_templates`, `brands`
- Added `folder_id` reference to `card_mockups`
- Full backward compatibility - existing mockups work without migration

**UI Components**:
- `FolderTree`: Hierarchical folder navigator with expand/collapse
- `CreateFolderModal`: Folder creation with validation
- `RenameFolderModal`: Rename folders with duplicate checking
- `DeleteFolderModal`: Delete with cascade warnings and mockup preservation
- `FolderSelector`: Dropdown selector for assigning folders

**API Routes**:
- `GET /api/folders` - List user's folders (personal + shared)
- `POST /api/folders` - Create new folder
- `PATCH /api/folders/[id]` - Rename folder or toggle org sharing
- `DELETE /api/folders/[id]` - Delete folder (mockups moved to unsorted)
- `PATCH /api/mockups/[id]` - Move mockup to folder
- `DELETE /api/mockups/[id]` - Delete mockup with storage cleanup

#### Organization-Scoped Data Isolation
- **Multi-Tenant Architecture**: Complete data isolation between organizations
- **Organization Filtering**: All queries automatically filtered by `organization_id`
- **Organization Switcher**: Clerk's OrganizationSwitcher integrated in sidebar
- **Admin Role Support**: Organization admin vs member role enforcement
- **Secure RLS Policies**: Row-level security at database level

### üîß Improvements

- Updated all API routes to support Next.js 15's async `params`
- Fixed async `auth()` calls throughout the application
- Resolved Lucide React icon prop compatibility issues
- Successfully compiling with Next.js 15.5.5 and Turbopack

#### Mobile Responsiveness

- **Hamburger Menu**: Relocated to header for better mobile UX
- **Overflow Fixes**: Resolved horizontal scroll issues on mobile
- **Touch-Friendly**: Larger touch targets and spacing for mobile users
- **Sticky Header**: Improved header behavior with user name display

#### User Experience
- **Auto-Navigation**: After logo upload, automatically redirects to library view
- **Collapsible Navigation**: Accordion-style navigation in sidebar
- **Authentication Pages**: Clean auth pages without sidebar/header
- **User Profile**: Display user name and photo in header
- **Toast Notifications**: Consistent success/error feedback

### üêõ Bug Fixes
